- 👋 Hi, I’m [Ryan SVIHLA](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-svihla-096752182/)
- 👀 I’m interested in languages of all kinds and would like to continue to learn French, Spanish and Portuguese and then someday pick up German and Italian. Tech wise I am most interested in building infrastructure and distributed systems, I also really like analyzing logs for some reason.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning for languages French because I live in France. For programming I am spending a lot of time on parsing logs and the Go programming language.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Go projects, anything in infrastructure or distributed dev.
